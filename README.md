# Features
1 - Authentication
Users can register themselves or login with an existing account to access their TodoList. Passwords are hashed with the BCrypt algorithm for security.

2 - Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Tasks
Once authenticated, users can create new tasks, view their existing tasks, update their tasks or delete them. Each task has a title, description, due date and a completion status.

3 - Multiple Task Selection
Users can select multiple tasks at once by checking their corresponding checkboxes. This allows them to mark them as completed or not with a single action.
